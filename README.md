# Beef Noodle

## Description
This is a simple HTTP REST API boilerplate for Node.js. It is built on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) 
use for starting any server side API projects. It is also integrated with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation.

## What is REST API?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
Key characteristics of REST are likely to be:
- Resources are identified by global IDs (which are typically URIs).
- REST-based architectures use the HTTP protocol for all CRUD operations.
- REST-based architectures typically involve collections of resources.
- REST-based architectures use a stateless client-server protocol, such as HTTP, so that the server-side data and client-side user interface are completely decoupled.
- REST-based architectures typically support caching at different levels to improve performance.
- REST-based architectures use standard HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, and PATCH.
- REST-based architectures typically use JSON for data serialization but may use XML as well.
- REST-based architectures typically support multiple representations of resources.
- REST-based architectures typically support hypermedia links for traversing a collection of resources.
- REST-based architectures typically support sorting and filtering of collection resources.
- REST-based architectures typically support pagination of collection resources.
- REST-based architectures typically support partial resource retrieval.
- REST-based architectures typically support partial resource modification.
- REST-based architectures typically support optimistic concurrency control.
- REST-based architectures typically support conditional requests.
- REST-based architectures typically support asynchronous operations.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via interceptors.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via filters.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via handlers.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via middleware.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via decorators.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via aspects.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via events.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via plugins.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via mixins.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via modules.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via extensions.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via adapters.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via proxies.
- REST-based architectures typically support cross-cutting concerns via wrappers.
